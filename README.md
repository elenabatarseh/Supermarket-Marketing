# Supermarket-Marketing
Abstract
This exploratory data analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior in response to a marketing campaign. The primary target variable is whether a customer accepted the offer (Response, 1 = Accepted, 0 = Not Accepted). Key factors analyzed include income, spending patterns across product categories, website visits, and total spending. The goal is to identify the drivers of offer acceptance, which can inform marketing strategies and customer segmentation.

The dataset includes demographic details, household information, and purchasing behaviors. By using bar charts, box plots, and other visualizations, we derive actionable insights into customer preferences and behaviors.
